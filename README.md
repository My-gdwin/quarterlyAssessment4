## Overview

This Python project generates a daily newsletter using the latest news headlines. The process includes:

2. Summarizing article content using OpenAI's GPT API.
3. Formatting the summarized content into a winter-themed HTML newsletter.
4. Sending the newsletter via email using Gmail.

## Features

- **Article Scraping**: Uses `newspaper3k` and `BeautifulSoup` to extract content from news articles.
- **Summarization**: OpenAI's GPT model generates summaries and formats them as newsletters.
- **HTML Formatting**: The newsletter is outputted in a winter-themed HTML design, complete with a snowman emoji ‚òÉÔ∏è.
- **Email Delivery**: Sends the generated newsletter directly to specified recipients via Gmail.

## Setup

1. Open the `main.py` file and replace the placeholders with your credentials:
   ```python
   newsapi_key = "your_newsapi_key"
   openai_key = "your_openai_key"

   GMAIL_USERNAME = "your_gmail_username"
   GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD = "your_gmail_app_password"
   ```

2. Ensure Gmail App Passwords are enabled. Follow [this guide](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en) to generate an app password.
